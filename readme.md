My KNN project can be found in the "KNN" folder.
My Linear Regression project can be found in the "linearRegression" folder.
I have written two writing tasks. These can be found in the "writing" folder. They are both formatted as markdown documents.
## Libraries:
My KNN and Linear Regression projects use many libraries. These include:
### Scikit Learn
Referenced as sklearn; this library contains many tools for machine learning.
### Pandas
This library is used for analysing data.
### NumPy
This library gives us support for multi dimensional arrays and tables when analysing csv data.
